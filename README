Hereyago.

Hereyago is a rails app which uses Devise and Paperclip.

Here's my currently wishlist of features:
- A "sender" account can login, and choose a file to upload.  Enter an email address and hit send.  
- The recipient will recieve an email URL and a generated password. Clicks the URL, enters the password, gets the file(s).
- Optionally, the sender could choose to have the file automatically deleted after the recipient completes the download.
- Optionally, the sender could choose to have the generated account/attachment expire if not DL'd after a certain timeframe.
- Optionally multiple recipients of the same file
- Optionally the FROM field of the email can be the sender's email address.



I've come to learn that Hereyago is basically an open source Yousendit* that you can host yourself on your own server.
edit:  oh also apparently there's a PHP app called Open Upload (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openupload) too. 
Whatever.  Mine's going to be better.
